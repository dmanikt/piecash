## Android application to track debts within your friend group.

Living off campus with your close friends is a fun and rewarding experience. With new responsibilities it can be hard to keep track of the little things. Every week you are buying groceries, toiletries, dinner and many other important communal necessities. Its hard to keep track of who owes who and what your roommates already paid you for. Its also annoying to see your bank statements riddled with instant transactions. Our app plans on simplifying this process.
